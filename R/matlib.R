#' matlib: Matrix Functions for Teaching and Learning Linear Algebra and Multivariate Statistics.
#'
#'
#' These functions are mainly for tutorial purposes in learning matrix algebra
#' ideas using R. In some cases, functions are provided for concepts available
#' elsewhere in R, but where the function call or name is not obvious.  In other
#' cases, functions are provided to show or demonstrate an algorithm.
#'
#' These are not meant for production uses. Other methods are more efficient for larger problems.
