**Matrix Functions for Teaching and Learning Linear Algebra and Multivariate Statistics**, http://friendly.github.io/matlib/

Version 0.9.6

These functions are mainly for tutorial purposes in teaching & learning matrix algebra
ideas using R. In some cases, functions are provided for concepts or computations available
elsewhere in R, but where the name is not obvious, e.g., `R()` for the rank of a matrix,
or `tr()` for matrix trace.

In other
cases, we provide cover functions to show or demonstrate an algorithm in more detail, sometimes
providing a `verbose =` argument to print the details of computations, e.g., `Det()` for a
matrix determinant, `Inverse()` for a matrix inverse, using `gaussianElimination()` to show the
steps.

In addition, a collection of functions are provided for drawing vector diagrams in 2D and 3D, illustrating
various concepts of linear algebra more concretely than has been available before.
For example, 

* `showEqn(A, b)` shows the matrix equations $A x = b$ in text or LaTeX form, while
`plotEqn(A, b)` and `plotEqn3d(A, b)` plots those equations in 2D or 3D space.

* `vectors()`, `vectors3d()` plot geometric vector diagrams in 2D or 3D, with other functions to draw
angles and arcs.

* `regvec3d()` calculates and plot vectors representing a bivariate regression model, `lm(y ~ x1 + x2)`

## Installation

Get the released version from CRAN:

     install.packages("matlib")

The development version can be installed to your R library directly from this repo via:

     if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
     remotes::install_github("friendly/matlib", build_vignettes = TRUE)

This installs the package from the source and creates the package vignettes, 
so you will need to have R Tools installed on your system.  [R Tools for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
takes you to the download page for Windows.  [R Tools for Mac OS X](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/)
has the required programs for Mac OS X.

The functions that draw 3D graphs use the **rgl** package. On macOS, **rgl** requires that [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) be installed. After installing XQuartz, it's necessary either to log out of and back into your macOS account or to reboot your Mac.


## Topics
The functions in this package are grouped under the following topics

1. **Convenience functions**:  

  - `tr()` - trace of a matrix
  - `R()` - rank of a matrix
  - `J()` - constant vector, matrix or array
  - `len()` - Euclidean length of a vector or columns of a matrix
  - `vec()` - vectorize a matrix
  - `Proj(y, X)` - projection of vector y on columns of matrix **X**
  - `mpower(A, p)` - matrix powers for a square symmetric matrix
  - `xprod(...)` - vector cross-product

2. **Determinants**: functions for calculating determinants by cofactor expansion

  - `minor()` - Minor of A[i,j]
  - `cofactor()` - Cofactor of A[i,j]
  - `rowMinors()` - Row minors of A[i,]
  - `rowCofactors()` - Row cofactors of A[i,]
  - `Det()` - Determinants by elimination or eigenvalues

3. **Elementary row operations**: functions for solving linear equations "manually" by the steps used in row echelon form and Gaussian elimination

  - `rowadd()` - Add multiples of rows to other rows
  - `rowmult()` - Multiply rows by constants
  - `rowswap()` - Interchange two rows of a matrix

4. **Linear equations**: functions to illustrate linear equations of the form $\mathbf{A x = b}$

  - `showEqn(A, b)` - show matrices (A, b) as linear equations
  - `plotEqn(A, b)`, `plotEqn3d(A, b)`  - plot matrices (A, b) as linear equations
  
5. **Gaussian elimination**: functions for illustrating Gaussian elimination for solving systems of linear equations of the form
$\mathbf{A x = b}$.  These functions provide a `verbose=TRUE` argument to show the intermediate steps
and a `fractions=TRUE` argument to show results using `MASS::fractions()`.

  - `gaussianElimination(A, B)` - reduces $(A, B)$ to $(I, A^{-1} B)$
  - `Inverse(X)`, `inv()` - uses `gaussianElimination` to find the inverse of X, $\mathbf{X}^{-1}$
  - `echelon(X)` - uses `gaussianElimination` to find the reduced echelon form of X
  - `Ginv(X)` - uses `gaussianElimination` to find the generalized inverse of X
  - `LU(X)` - LU decomposition of a matrix X
  - `cholesky(X)` - calculates a Cholesky square root of a matrix
  - `swp()` - matrix sweep operator

6. **Eigenvalues**: functions to illustrate the algorithms for calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors and related matrix decompositions and generalizations.

  - `Eigen()` - eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  - `SVD()` - singular value decomposition, \$mathbf{X = U D V}$
  - `powerMethod()` - find the dominant eigenvector using the power method 
  - `showEig()` - draw eigenvectors on a 2D scatterplot with a dataEllipse
  - `MoorePenrose()` - illustrates how the Moore-Penrose inverse can be calculated using `SVD()`

7. **Vector diagrams**: functions for drawing vector diagrams in 2D and 3D

  - `arrows3d()` - draw nice 3D arrows
  - `corner()`, `arc()` -  draw a corner or arc showing the angle between two vectors in 2D/3D
  - `pointOnLine()` - position of a point along a line
  - `vectors()`, `vectors3d()` - plot geometric vector diagrams in 2D/3D 
  - `regvec3d()` - calculate and plot vectors representing a bivariate regression model, `lm(y ~ x1 + x2)` in mean-deviation form.
