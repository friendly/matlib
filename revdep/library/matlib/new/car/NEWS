Changes to Version 3.1-3

  o Clarify docs to explain that ... argument is not passed to .vcov when it's a function in calls to Anova(), confidence Elliipse(), Confint(), deltaMethod(), linearHypothesis(), and S() (suggestion of Joe Ritter).
  
  o make dataEllipse() generic and add default and formula methods (with help of Michael Friendly).
  
  o linearHypothesis() no longer issues a warning when a hypothesis matrix is supplied for coefficients whose names include arithmetic operators (following report by Robert Baer about unnecessary warnings printed by Anova(), which calls linearHypothesis()).
  
  o deltaMethod() now allows models with aliased coefficients when argument singular.ok=TRUE.
  
  o Anova() method for "coxph" objects no longer computes incorrect LR tests for models using the tt argument; in this case, Wald tests are substituted (following bug report by Ken Beath).

  o Tweak linearHypothesis() for multinom models and add example.

  o Added an error.df argument to the default methods of linearHypothesis() and Anova() for computing F-tests; if the argument is unspecified, then df.residual() is applied to the model, and if df.residual() returns NULL or NA, then an asymptotic chi-square test is substituted for the F-test (in response to a report by Adrian Olszewski that Anova() fails for gls models when an F-test is requested).

  o Added argument to spread.level.plot.default() to optionally suppress point labels (suggested by Josyf Mychaleckyj).

  o vif() modified by Henric Nilsson to be applicable to generalized linear models and other models inheriting from class lm. Weighted linear models are now allowed.

  o The car package now has a namespace.

  o Fixes to Anova.multinom and Anova.polr reflecting changes to multinom and polr (thanks Huaibao Feng for a bug report).

  o  The name of the function influence.plot was changed to influencePlot to avoid confusion with the influence generic in the stats package.

  o  Error in Bfox data set is now pointed out.

  o  levene.test now checks that second argument is a factor.

  o  For models with only an intercept, Anova() with type="II" now substitutes equivalent type="III" tests (since the code for type="II" doesn't handle intercepts). This is especially useful for repeated-measures designs with only within-subjects factors (in response to a problem reported by Ralf Goertz).

Changes to Version 1.2-7

  o  Added Mauchly tests for sphericity in repeated-measures designs to summary.Anova.mlm() (suggested by Ralf Goertz).

Changes to Version 1.2-8

  o  Fixed bug in summary.Anova.mlm() that surfaced when all univariate repeated-measures tests have 1 df and hence GG and HF corrections don't apply to any of the tests (reported by Ralf Goertz).

  o  levene.test() is now generic, contributed by  Derek Ogle.
