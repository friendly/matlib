\title{Generalized Vector Cross Product}
\usage{
xprod(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{N-1 linearly independent vectors of the same length, N.}
}
\value{
Returns the generalized vector cross-product, a vector of length N.
}
\description{
Given two linearly independent length 3 vectors **a** and **b**, the cross product, \eqn{\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}}
(read "a cross b"), is a vector that is perpendicular to both **a** and **b**
thus normal to the plane containing them.
}
\details{
A generalization of this idea applies to two or more dimensional vectors.

See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product] for geometric and algebraic properties.

\examples{
xprod(1:3, 4:6)

# This works for an dimension
xprod(c(0,1))             # 2d
xprod(c(1,0,0), c(0,1,0)) # 3d
xprod(c(1,1,1), c(0,1,0)) # 3d
xprod(c(1,0,0,0), c(0,1,0,0), c(0,0,1,0)) # 4d
