Data on Coffee, Stress and Heart Damage
}
\description{
A dataset, used for examples in Friendly, Fox & Monette (2013),
giving an index of cardiac damage (\code{Heart})
in relation to a measure of daily coffee consumption (\code{Coffee})
and \code{Stress}, a measure of perceived occupational stress,
in a contrived sample of \eqn{n = 20} university people.
}

\usage{data("coffee")}
\format{
  A data frame with 20 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Group}}{university group, a factor with levels \code{Grad_Student} \code{Professor} \code{Student}}
    \item{\code{Coffee}}{a measure of daily coffee consumption}
    \item{\code{Stress}}{a measure of perceived occupational stress}
    \item{\code{Heart}}{an index of cardiac damage}
  }
}
\details{
The main goal for analysis of this teaching example would be
to determine whether or not coffee is good or bad for your heart, and stress
represents one potential confounding variable among others (age, smoking, etc.)
that might be useful to control statistically.

Friendly et al. (2013) use this data to illustrate
(a) data ellipses in data space and the corresponding confidence ellipses in 
parameter (\eqn{\beta}) space; (b) effects of measurement error in a predictor or response;
(c) added-variable plots and more.
